# Creating-a-Stateless-Widget-with-Images-and-Text-Task
# Overview
create a Stateless Widget in Flutter that displays two images and customized text.
# What Does This Code Do?
1. Displays an app with a title bar labeled "My First Project".
2. Shows a local image of a cat and a network image of a panda.
3. Arranges images and labels using rows and columns for proper alignment.
# How the Code Works?
1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. A Scaffold is used to structure the screen into an app bar and a main body.
3. Images and labels are organized using a Row and Column for horizontal and vertical alignment.
4. The first image is loaded from local assets, and the second is fetched from a URL
